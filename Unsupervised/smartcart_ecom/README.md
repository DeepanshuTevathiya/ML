**SmartCart – Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Learning**

This project builds a customer segmentation system for an e-commerce platform using unsupervised machine learning. The goal is to discover hidden patterns in customer behaviour and group similar customers together for better business decisions.

**Problem**:
Many e-commerce platforms use the same marketing strategy for all customers. This leads to inefficient marketing, poor targeting, and missed opportunities to retain valuable customers.
This project solves that problem by clustering customers based on their purchasing behaviour and engagement.

**Dataset**:
The dataset contains 2240 customers with 22 features including:

Demographics (age, education, income, family status)
Product spending
Purchase frequency
Website activity
Recency and complaints

These features help identify meaningful customer segments.

**Approach**:

Project workflow:
Data Cleaning
Feature Engineering
Encoding & Scaling
PCA for dimensionality reduction
Finding optimal clusters (Elbow Method)
K-Means Clustering
Cluster analysis and insights

**Tech Stack**:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn

**Key Insights From Clustering**:
The clustering process reveals groups such as:

High spending loyal customers
Discount-driven shoppers
Low engagement customers
Potential churn customers

**Example Use Cases**:

Personalized marketing campaigns
Customer retention strategies
Identifying high-value customers
Product recommendation systems
Business intelligence
