# SmartCart – Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Learning

This project builds a customer segmentation system for an e-commerce platform using unsupervised machine learning. The goal is to discover hidden patterns in customer behaviour and group similar customers together for better business decisions.

## Problem

Many e-commerce platforms use the same marketing strategy for all customers. This leads to:

- Inefficient marketing  
- Poor targeting  
- Missed opportunities to retain valuable customers  

This project solves that problem by clustering customers based on their purchasing behaviour and engagement.

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains **2240 customers with 22 features**, including:

- Demographics (age, education, income, family status)  
- Product spending  
- Purchase frequency  
- Website activity  
- Recency and complaints  

These features help identify meaningful customer segments.
